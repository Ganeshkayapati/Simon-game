# [Simon Game](https://ganeshkayapati.github.io/Simon-game/)

## Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic **Simon Game**. The game challenges players to remember and repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds. It's a fun way to test and improve memory skills!

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: The game presents a sequence of colors and sounds that the player needs to remember and repeat.
- **Difficulty Levels**: The game gets progressively harder as the sequence becomes longer with each round.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive and can be played on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS3**: For styling the game and providing a responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For the game logic, including generating sequences, handling user input, and managing game states.

## How to Play

0.Press any key on keyboard to start the game
1. The game starts with a single color button lighting up and playing a sound.
2. The player must click the same button.
3. In the next round, the game will play the first button and add one more button to the sequence.
4. The player must repeat the entire sequence.
5. The game continues to add one more button to the sequence with each round.
